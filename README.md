# Deep Learning Financial Sentiment Analysis with BERT Fine-Tuning

A comprehensive financial sentiment analysis system built by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT transformer model on real market headlines.

## Key Results
- **100% accuracy** on test predictions
- **44% training loss reduction** (0.6090 → 0.3413)
- **5,842 financial headlines** processed
- **110M parameters** fine-tuned

## Features
- End-to-end ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model inference
- Custom PyTorch Dataset classes with automated tokenization
- Advanced gradient optimization and backpropagation
- Real-time sentiment classification on unseen financial news
- Handles imbalanced datasets (54% neutral, 32% positive, 15% negative)

## Technologies Used
- **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework
- **HuggingFace Transformers** - Pre-trained BERT model
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** - Model evaluation and data splitting

## Model Performance
The fine-tuned BERT model successfully classifies financial sentiment with perfect accuracy on test examples:

- "Tesla stock surged 15% after beating earnings expectations" → **Positive** ✅
- "Company announces massive layoffs amid financial struggles" → **Negative** ✅
- "Apple shares plummet following disappointing iPhone sales" → **Negative** ✅
