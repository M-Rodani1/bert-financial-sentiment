# Project Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the major improvements made to the BERT Financial Sentiment Analysis project.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Validation Evaluation
**Problem:** Original implementation only tracked training loss with no validation metrics.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive validation evaluation loop after each training epoch.

**Impact:** Enables accurate assessment of model generalization and detection of overfitting.

---

### 2. Per-Class Performance Metrics
**Problem:** Overall accuracy (81.5%) masked severe underperformance on minority class.

**Solution:** Implemented precision, recall, and F1-score tracking using `sklearn.metrics.classification_report`.

**Key Finding:** Negative class had only 28.6% recall despite 81.5% overall accuracy - model was failing to detect negative sentiment.

---

### 3. Class Weights for Imbalanced Data
**Problem:** Dataset imbalance (54% neutral, 32% positive, 15% negative) caused model to ignore minority class.

**Solution:** Implemented weighted loss function with class weights inversely proportional to class frequency:
- Negative: 2.27
- Neutral: 0.62
- Positive: 1.05

**Results:**
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Negative Recall | 28.6% | 87.4% | +58.8pp |
| Negative F1 | 0.41 | 0.66 | +61% |
| Overall Accuracy | 81.5% | 79.4% | -2.1pp* |

*Minor accuracy drop is acceptable given massive improvement in minority class detection

### 4. Early Stopping
**Problem:** Fixed 2-epoch training was arbitrary and risked underfitting or overfitting.

**Solution:** Implemented early stopping with patience=3 and model checkpointing.

**Results:** Training automatically stopped at epoch 2 when validation loss began increasing (0.45 → 0.54 → 0.63), preventing overfitting and using best model checkpoint.

---

### 5. Learning Rate Scheduling
**Problem:** Constant learning rate may be suboptimal for convergence.

**Solution:** Implemented linear warmup (10% of steps) followed by linear decay using `get_linear_schedule_with_warmup`.

**Observation:** Minimal impact in this case due to small dataset and already-pretrained BERT, but valuable technique for future projects.

## Final Results

### Best Model Performance (Epoch 2)
```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
    negative     0.5276    0.8743    0.6581       175
     neutral     0.9426    0.7122    0.8114       622
    positive     0.8117    0.8925    0.8502       372
    
    accuracy                         0.7938      1169
```

### Key Achievements

## Technical Implementation

### Class Weights Calculation
```python
def calculate_class_weights(labels):
    unique_labels, counts = np.unique(labels, return_counts=True)
    total_samples = len(labels)
    num_classes = len(unique_labels)
    weights = total_samples / (num_classes * counts)
    return torch.FloatTensor(weights)

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=class_weights)
```

### Early Stopping Usage
```python
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(patience=3, min_delta=0.001)

for epoch in range(max_epochs):
    # Training...
    # Validation...
    
    if early_stopping(val_loss, model):
        break

early_stopping.load_best_model(model)
```

### Validation Evaluation
```python
model.eval()
all_predictions = []
all_labels = []

with torch.no_grad():
    for batch in val_loader:
        outputs = model(input_ids=batch["input_ids"], 
                       attention_mask=batch["attention_mask"])
        predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)
        all_predictions.extend(predictions.cpu().numpy())
        all_labels.extend(batch['label'].cpu().numpy())

print(classification_report(all_labels, all_predictions, 
                           target_names=['Negative', 'Neutral', 'Positive']))
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Accuracy is misleading with imbalanced data** - A model predicting only the majority class can achieve high accuracy while being completely useless.

2. **F1-score reveals true performance** - Per-class metrics expose problems hidden by overall accuracy.

3. **Class weights are essential** - Without them, models ignore minority classes in imbalanced datasets.

4. **Validation is non-negotiable** - Training metrics alone cannot detect overfitting.

5. **Early stopping prevents overfitting** - Validation loss increased while training loss decreased, proving the model was beginning to memorize rather than learn.

6. **Pre-trained models are powerful** - Only 2,307 new parameters (0.002% of total) needed task-specific training.

## Future Work
- Implement k-fold cross-validation for more robust performance estimates
- Add confusion matrix visualization
- Implement prediction confidence thresholds
- Try larger models (BERT-large, FinBERT)
- Collect more minority class examples
- Implement data augmentation (back-translation, synonym replacement)

**Key Metric Improvement:** Negative class F1-score +61% (0.41 → 0.66)
